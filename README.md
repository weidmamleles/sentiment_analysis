# sentiment_analysis
This work presents the application of sentiment analysis to the SFU_Review_Corpus dataset, which contains 400 reviews. Sentiment analysis was performed using different classification models: a simple model comparing with a sentiment lexicon and machine learning models. In the simple model, experiments were created where the treatment of negation and some pre-processing were used. While with machine learning, several scenarios were tested combining two types of vectorization and various forms of pre-processing, such as punctuation removal, lowerization, tokenization, lemmatization and stemming. With this, it was possible to conclude that the machine learning models with vectorization by word count and with the combination of several pre-processing presented the best results.
